// The Dining Philosophers problem is well known in computer science circles.
// Five philosophers, numbered from 0 through 4, live in a house where the
// table is laid for them; each philosopher has their own place at the table.
// Their only difficulty – besides those of philosophy – is that the dish
// served is a very difficult kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with
// two forks. There are two forks next to each plate, so that presents no
// difficulty. As a consequence, however, this means that no two neighbours
// may be eating simultaneously.
